# Scavenger Hunt!
![](https://github.com/legacybass/scavenger-hunt/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

This is a basic site that's been created to provide anyone with an internet connection something to do when bored. The idea arose because of the quarantine measures currently in place because of Covid-19 as people were looking for ways to have some sort of interaction. The site supports areas, and the current version is setup to use one as the main scavenger hunt site. Others can be added, since there were a number of ideas thrown around that can all be implemented.
